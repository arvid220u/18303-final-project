# 18303-final-project
Investigating the ETDRK4 scheme for solving stiff PDEs using Julia.

The Kuramotoâ€“Sivashinsky equation is solved in `ks.jl` and the Korteweg-de Vries is solved in `kdv.jl`.

The `arvid-lunnemark-18303-final-paper.pdf` includes the plots generated by the scripts `figureX.jl`.
